=====================

A list of lightweight [versions of] websites without all the bloat.
Websites included include no, or very little JavaScript and are smaller than 1MB in size (usually smaller by a significant margin).

This list is still young and I would like to hear your feedback on what should or should not be included, please submit an issue or contribute to on-going discussions.
